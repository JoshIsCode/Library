                "The lighthouse loomed in the distance, its shadow cutting through the mist like a sentinel guarding the secrets of the sea.",
                "Sarah clutched her suitcase as the boat approached the rocky shore, her heart pounding in rhythm with the waves crashing against the cliffs.",
                "She had inherited the lighthouse from her estranged uncle, a man she barely remembered. The letter had come two weeks ago, urging her to take over the property immediately. Now, as the boatman handed her a weathered key, she wondered what she had gotten herself into.",
                "Inside the lighthouse, the air was thick with the smell of salt and old wood. Dust motes floated in the beams of sunlight piercing through the cracked windows. The spiral staircase creaked under her feet as she climbed to the top, where a massive lens, long extinguished, stood like a relic of a forgotten time."

            "Paragraphs": [
                "The keeper's quarters were small and sparsely furnished, but the walls were lined with books and journals.",
                "Sarah flipped through one of the journals, its pages filled with intricate sketches of the coastline and strange, cryptic symbols.",
                "She was startled by a knock at the door. A wiry man with piercing gray eyes introduced himself as Mr. Cartwright, the former keeper. His presence was unsettling, his voice low and deliberate as he spoke of the lighthouse's 'unique history.'",
                "'Be careful at night,' he warned, his gaze lingering on the spiral staircase. 'Some things are better left in the dark.'"

                "That night, a fierce storm rolled in, the wind howling like a beast outside the windows.",
                "Sarah struggled to sleep, her mind racing with questions about the lighthouse and Mr. Cartwright\u2019s cryptic warning.",
                "As thunder shook the walls, she heard footsteps echoing up the staircase. Grabbing a flashlight, she descended cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest. The light flickered across the walls, revealing nothing but empty rooms.",
                "But as she reached the ground floor, the beam of her flashlight fell on a figure standing at the edge of the cliff. Lightning illuminated the scene, and in that brief moment, she saw a face twisted in anguish before the figure vanished into the storm."
