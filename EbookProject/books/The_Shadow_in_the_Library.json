                "Her curiosity piqued, she asked her supervisor about it, but he only shook his head. 'Some books are best left unread,' he said."

                "Unable to resist, Claire snuck into the restricted section after closing. She found a hidden door behind the shelves, its handle cold under her touch.",
                "Inside was a room filled with ancient tomes and a single chair. As she stepped closer, she felt a chill and noticed a shadow moving in the corner.",
                "'Who's there?' she whispered, but no one answered. The shadow grew larger, and the air grew colder as she backed toward the door."
